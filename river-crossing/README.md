# The River-Crossing Problem

![river](https://github.com/MiradoConsulting/tla-workshop/blob/main/river-crossing/Vovk_koza_kapusta.png)

A farmer, a fox, a goat and a cabbage are together on one side of a river.

There is a boat that can cross the river.  Only the farmer can sail the boat across the river and back, and it has room for only one other item/passenger.

If the farmer is near them, the fox will eat the goat.

If the farmer is not near them, the goat will eat the cabbage.

How do all four make it across the river intact?
